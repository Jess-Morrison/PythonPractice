#Hello again, I cant practice too much tonight but I am going to dabble 
# with some Lists

print(cookies)

#Lets see if I can grab Chocochip from the list 

print(cookies[1])

#I am going to grab some Sugar cookies 

print(cookies[0])

#Lets put the Gingerbread in lowercase 

print(cookies[2].lower())

#Now lets try to make all the cookies lower case 

print(cookies[0].lower())
print(cookies[1].lower())

#So, dont tell my family but, I'm not a huge Gingerbread fan
#So lets cut it from the list 

del(cookies[2])
print(cookies)

#It had to be done...but lets add Oatmeal

cookies.append('Oatmeal')
print(cookies)

#I actually want to add Oatmeal to the front of the list 

cookies.insert(0, 'Oatmeal')

# I didnt mean to add Oatmeal twice, so lets delete the Oatmeal on the end

cookies.pop()

#Sugar cookies can be a bit sweet, so I have to take it off 

cookies.pop(1)

#Have to end it here but I will be back at it
