## I will be practicing a bit of Python to revisit some key concepts##

##Will start off with something simple as a greeting##

greeting= "Hello World"
print (greeting)

##Lets practice Changing Cases## 

#This shows the name all in Upper Case#

name= "cory kenshin"
print (name.upper())

#Since I already created a variable, lets display it as a Lower Case#

print (name.lower())

#Now, lets only capitalize the First and Last Name#

print (name.title())

#So, I got distracted with a Django tutorial so I have to end it here
